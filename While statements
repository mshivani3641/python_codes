Python While Loops 
i = 1 
while i < 6: 
  print(i) 
  i += 1 
o/p:: 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
 
 
The break Statement 
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true: 
i = 1 
while i < 6: 
  print(i) 
  if i == 3: 
    break 
  i += 1 
o/p: 
1 
2 
3 

The continue Statement 
Continue to the next iteration if i is 3: 
i = 0 
while i < 6: 
  i += 1  
  if i == 3: 
    continue 
  print(i) 
o/p: 
1 
2 
4 
5 
6 

The else Statement 
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true: 
i = 1 
while i < 6: 
  print(i) 
  i += 1 
else: 
  print("i is no longer less than 6") 
 
 
o/p:: 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
i is no longer less than 6
