* Using AND in conditional statements:: 
a = 200 
b = 33 
c = 500 
if a > b and c > a: 
print("Both conditions are True") 
o/p:::: 
Both conditions are True 

* Using OR in conditional statements:: 
a = 200 
b = 33 
c = 500 
if a > b or a > c: 
print("At least one of the conditions is True") 
o/p:::: 
At least one of the conditions is True 

* Using NOT in conditional statements:: 
a = 33 
b = 200 
if not a > b: 
print("a is NOT greater than b") 
o/p::: 
a is NOT greater than b
